Hekswerk — Business Plan (Consolidated)
1. Executive Summary
Hekswerk is a solo consultancy offering privacy‑first, maintainable automation for small businesses and independent professionals. The practice focuses on designing and implementing one clearly scoped automated workflow at a time, rather than full operational overhauls or ongoing platform maintenance.
The core value proposition is simple: clarity, durability, and ownership. Clients receive an automation that solves a specific operational pain point, along with clear documentation and handoff materials that allow them to understand, maintain, and adapt the workflow themselves.
Hekswerk is intentionally small, high‑touch, and craft‑oriented. It favors correctness and explainability over scale, opacity, or vendor lock‑in.
2. Founder & Operating Model
Hekswerk is operated as a sole proprietorship by Levi Banks under an Assumed Business Name (ABN).
The business is designed to: - Operate remotely - Support location independence (including future residence in the Netherlands) - Maintain low overhead - Scale through pricing and selectivity, not volume
The consultancy does not employ subcontractors, nor does it offer 24/7 support or monitoring services. Each engagement is finite and deliverable‑based.
3. Core Product Offering
Hekswerk Quickstart Automation
One problem. One workflow. Built to last.
Each engagement delivers a single, well‑defined automation that replaces or simplifies a manual business process.
Examples include: - Intake triage and routing (email, form, or document‑based) - Status change notifications - Simple record synchronization between tools - Reminder or follow‑up automation - File organization or handoff workflows
This offering explicitly excludes: - Full business process redesigns - Multi‑department or enterprise workflows - Ongoing performance tracking or analytics - Continuous maintenance contracts
4. Deliverables
Each Quickstart engagement includes:
Workflow Mapping
A clear, human‑readable explanation of the process being automated
Explicit inputs, outputs, and failure modes
Implemented Automation
Built using appropriate tooling (often n8n, Make, Zapier, or custom lightweight solutions)
Preference for privacy‑respecting and self‑hostable tools when feasible
Documentation
Plain‑language written documentation
Visual flow overview
Notes on how to modify or disable the automation
Loom Handoff Videos
Walkthrough of how the automation works
How to troubleshoot common issues
How to safely extend or adjust the workflow
Client Ownership
Credentials and access remain with the client
No hidden dependencies
No proprietary black boxes
5. Target Clients
Hekswerk serves: - Small service businesses - Solo professionals - Legal‑adjacent operations (non‑representational) - Consultants and creatives - Administrative‑heavy roles that benefit from automation clarity
Ideal clients value: - Transparency - Control over their systems - Privacy and data stewardship - Solutions that can be understood, not merely used
6. Pricing Model
Pricing is flat‑fee per workflow, based on scope and complexity.
Indicative structure: - Base Quickstart Automation: fixed price - Optional add‑ons: - Additional documentation - Minor post‑handoff adjustments (within a defined window)
Hekswerk does not bill hourly for client‑facing work. Internal development and research time is not charged separately.
7. Tooling Philosophy
Hekswerk prioritizes: - Self‑hostable or privacy‑respecting platforms - Minimal data exposure - Clear failure modes - Tooling that clients can reasonably maintain
Common platforms may include: - n8n (self‑hosted where appropriate) - Zapier or Make for simpler client‑managed use cases - Custom scripts or lightweight services when justified
Tool choice is always explained and documented.
8. Marketing & Sales Approach
Hekswerk relies on: - Direct outreach - Referrals - A clear, well‑designed website - Plainspoken explanations of value
The brand intentionally avoids: - Growth hacking - Overpromising automation outcomes - Surveillance‑style dashboards
The tone is calm, precise, and confident.
9. Risk & Scope Control
To protect both client and operator capacity, Hekswerk enforces: - Clear scope definitions - Explicit exclusions - Written acceptance of deliverables - Finite engagement timelines
If a request exceeds scope, it is either declined or reframed as a separate engagement.
10. Future Optional Expansion
Possible future offerings (not core): - Second‑workflow bundles - Periodic review sessions - Educational materials on automation literacy
These are optional and do not change the core model.
11. Guiding Principle
Hekswerk exists to build automation that respects human understanding.
No opaque systems. No fragile glue. No mystery behavior.
Just careful craft, handed over with clarity.
