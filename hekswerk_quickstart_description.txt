Hekswerk Quickstart

Privacy-first automation. One workflow at a time.

Hekswerk builds clear, maintainable automations for small businesses and independent professionals who want fewer loose ends — without handing over control of their systems.

Each Quickstart engagement focuses on one well-scoped operational workflow, built carefully and handed off with documentation you can actually use.

No full operational overhauls.
No ongoing monitoring retainers.
No mystery automation you can’t understand.

Just steady craft.

What’s Included (Every Tier)

Each Quickstart delivers:

Workflow Mapping
A clear, human-readable map of the process being automated, including triggers, outcomes, and edge cases.

Automation Build
Implementation using the most appropriate tool for the job — often Zapier, Make, or self-hosted n8n — with a preference for privacy-respecting, client-owned systems.

Documentation
Plain-language written documentation explaining:

what the automation does

how it works

how to modify, pause, or disable it

Loom Handoff Videos
Recorded walkthroughs covering:

how the workflow operates

how to troubleshoot common issues

how to safely extend it in the future

Client Ownership
All accounts, credentials, and access remain with the client. No hidden dependencies or vendor lock-in.

“Always-on” automation supervision

Additional workflows can be scoped as separate engagements.

Who This Is For

Hekswerk Quickstart is a good fit if you want:

clarity over cleverness

systems you can understand and own

automation that reduces cognitive load without creating fragility

It’s especially well-suited to small service businesses and legal-adjacent operations.

The Hekswerk Philosophy

Automation should respect human understanding.

No opaque systems.
No brittle glue.
No surprise behavior.

Just careful work — designed, built, and handed over with intention.
